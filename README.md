# WorldMaker.Dwarf
my updated take on the clone of (https://github.com/Andres6936/WorldGeneration.Dwarf)

My intention is to get this running under Python 3.10 and the newest release of libtcodpy (1.24.0) distributed with the 
python-tcod release (16.2.2) and see what happens. Also since under Windows this has a second console screen to display
what is happening with the world generation and updates, but under Linux it does not, I plan on adding logging to do the 
same and then "tail /path/directory/output.log" can be used to follow said log in another terminal.

I'm just getting started with Python so I'm sure some of this will look "rough" to trained eyes but hey, gotta start 
somewhere right? We'll see how it goes.
